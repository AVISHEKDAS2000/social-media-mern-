            Are you looking for the best commands to teach your dog? Although
            having a trained dog isn’t the same as having a balanced dog,
            teaching your dog basic dog training commands can be helpful when
            tackling behavior problems despite whether they are existing ones or
            those that may develop in the future.
          </p>
          <p className="trainDogPara">
            So where exactly do you start with teaching your dog commands? While
            taking a class may be beneficial for you and your pup, there are
            many dog training commands you can teach your dog right at home.
            Below, we’ve listed the best list of dog commands you and your pup
            are guaranteed to enjoy.
          </p>
          <h4>Sit</h4>
          <p className='trainDogPara'>
            Teaching your dog to sit is one of the most basic dog commands to
            teach your pup, thus making it a great one to start with. A dog who
            knows the “Sit” command will be much calmer and easier to control
            than dogs who aren’t taught this simple command. Additionally, the
            “Sit” command prepares your dog for harder commands such as “Stay”
            and “Come.”
          </p>
        
          <p className='trainDogPara'>Here’s how to teach your dog the “Sit” command:</p>
          <p className='trainDogPara'>
            Hold a treat close to your dog’s nose. Move your hand up, allowing
            his head to follow the treat and causing his bottom to lower. Once
            he’s in sitting position, say “Sit,” give him the treat, and share
            affection. Repeat this sequence a few times every day until your dog
            has it mastered. Then ask your dog to sit before mealtime, when
            leaving for walks and during other situations when you’d like him
            calm and seated.
          </p>
          <h4>Come</h4>
          <p className='trainDogPara'>
            Another important command for your dog to learn is the word “come.”
            This command is extremely helpful for those times you lose grip on
            the leash or accidentally leave the front door open. Once again,
            this command is easy to teach and will help keep your dog out of
            trouble.
          </p>
          <p className='trainDogPara'>
          Put a leash and collar on your dog. Go down to his level and say,
          “Come,” while gently pulling on the leash. When he gets to you, reward
          him with affection and a treat. Once he’s mastered it with the leash,
          remove it and continue to practice the command in a safe, enclosed
          area.
          </p>
          <h4>Down</h4>
          <p className='trainDogPara'>
          This next command is one of the more difficult dog training commands
          to teach. The reason it may be hard for your dog to master this
          command is that it requires him to be in a submissive posture. You can
          help out your dog by keeping training positive and relaxed, especially
          if your dog is fearful or anxious. Also keep in mind to always praise
          your dog once he successfully follows the command.
          
          Find a particularly good smelling treat, and hold it in your closed
          fist. Hold your hand up to your dog’s snout. When he sniffs it, move
          your hand to the floor, so he follows. Then slide your hand along the
          ground in front of him to encourage his body to follow his head. Once
          he’s in the down position, say “Down,” give him the treat, and share
          affection. Repeat this training every day. If your dog tries to sit up
          or lunge toward your hand, say “No” and take your hand away. Don’t
          push him into a down position, and encourage every step your dog takes
          toward the right position. After all, he’s working hard to figure it
          out!
          </p>
          
          <h4>Stay</h4>
          <p className='trainDogPara'>
          Similar to the “Sit” command, the “Stay” cue will help make your dog
          easier to control. This command can be helpful in a number of
          situations such as those times you want your dog out of the way as you
          tend to household chores or when you don’t want your pup overwhelming
          guests.
          </p>
          
          <p className='trainDogPara'>
          Before attempting to teach your dog this command, make sure your dog
          is an expert at the “Sit” cue. If he hasn’t quite mastered the “Sit”
          command, take the time to practice it with him before moving on to the
          “Stay” cue.
          </p>
          
          <p className='trainDogPara'>
          First, ask your dog to “Sit.” Then open the palm of your hand in front
          of you, and say “Stay.” Take a few steps back. Reward him with a treat
          and affection if he stays. Gradually increase the number of steps you
          take before giving the treat. Always reward your pup for staying put —
          even if it’s just for a few seconds. This is an exercise in
          self-control for your dog, so don’t be discouraged if it takes a while
          to master, particularly for puppies and high-energy dogs. After all,
          most dogs prefer to be on the move rather than just sitting and
          waiting.
          </p>

          <h4>Leave It</h4>
          <p className='trainDogPara'>
          This last command can help keep your dog safe when his curiosity gets
          the better of him such as those times when he smells something
          intriguing but possibly dangerous on the ground. The goal is to teach
          your pup that he gets something even better for ignoring the other
          item.
          </p>
          
          <p className='trainDogPara'>
          Place a treat in both hands. Show him one enclosed fist with the treat
          inside and say “Leave it.” Ignore the behaviors as he licks, sniffs,
          mouths, paws and barks to get the treat. Once he stops trying, give
          him the treat from the other hand. Repeat until your dog moves away
          from that first fist when you say “Leave it.” Next, give your dog the
          treat only when he looks up at you as he moves away from the first
          fist. Once your dog consistently moves away from the first treat and
          gives you eye contact when you say the command, you’re ready to take
          it up a notch. For this next training method, use two different
          treats: one that’s good but not super-appealing and one that’s
          particularly good-smelling and tasty for your pup. Say “Leave it,”
          place the less-attractive treat on the floor and cover it with your
          hand. Wait until your dog ignores that treat and looks at you. Then
          remove that treat from the floor, give him the better treat and share
          affection immediately. Once he’s got it, place the less-tasty treat on
          the floor but don’t completely cover it with your hand. Instead, hold
          your hand a little bit above the treat. Over time, gradually move your
          hand farther and farther away until your hand is about 6 inches above.
          Now he’s ready to practice with you standing up! Follow the same
          steps, but if he tries to snatch the less-tasty treat, cover it with
          your foot. Don’t rush the process of teaching your pup any one of
          these dog training commands. Remember, you’re asking a lot of your
          dog. If you take it up a notch and he’s really struggling, go back to
          the previous stage. This list of dog commands can help protect your
          dog from dangerous situations as well as improve your communication
          with him. Taking the time to teach your pup these common dog commands
          is well worth the investment of your time and effort. Remember, the
          training process takes time, so start a dog-obedience training session
          only if you’re in the right mindset to practice calm-assertive energy
          and patience.
